It is the end of the year and that is always a great time to reflect on the previous year. We want to use this opportunity to share some insight on the platform as you are accustomed from us, of course, all based on data.

## Why did we start {{site.title}}?

</a>

The ambition of {{site.title}} is to be **the** research platform of the EUC space. We believe doing these kinds of researches helps the community, business and ourselves to educate and consult on complex IT questions.

It is always fun to play around with new technologies and explore the limits of these new products and systems. This will help us to better understand on how to use or implement new technologies. And on the other hand, we will also provide feedback to the vendors, which, in most cases, will also help to developer and make the products even better.

## {{site.title}} statistics 2019
In 2019 we have published 28 publications, with more than 37,000 unique visitors and over 60,000 page views from all over the world!

To get more interaction with you and the community we decided to create a Slack channel, which is growing with members. Until today we have researched 155 members. Our goal for next year is to reach 250 members, so if you haven’t signed up yet, please help us reach that number in 2020 right [here]({{site.slack}}){:target="_blank"}.

We also have new participants joined the platform this year. A few of the participants are working on the first publication.

Sharing knowledge is not only done using the website, we have presented our researches at various events the past year. In 2019 we have visited 6 different countries and presented at 8 events. One of the highlights was presenting at Citrix Synergy together with Eltjo van Gulik, in a fully packed room. A number of our previous presentations can be found on our website right [here]({{site.baseurl}}/presentations){:target="_blank"}.

Running the {{site.title}} is a team effort and that requires a close collaboration with each other. We spend over 60 hours in meetings with the team or with vendors to set priority and share insights. Next to all the meetings we have hosted two retrospective dinners where we met face to face.

Running this platform is made possible by [ICT-Partners](https://www.ict-partners.nl){:target="_blank"}. Without ICT-Partners we are not able to host the website and rent all the hardware for the researches. To provide some perspective, ICT-Partners invested over 15k euro the past year alone to make this platform possible. Big thank you!

## Next steps for {{site.title}}
Based on the statistics we can conclude that we are quite successful, but we are far from finished. We are going to continue delivering great researches with the latest hot topics and developments in the EUC space. As our goal is the be the research platform of the EUC space. It is our aim to reach even more people in 2020.

In order to achieve this, we need more participants on the platform that provide even more knowledge and insights. Our goal is to get at least five new participants at {{site.title}} in 2020.

In 2020, we also want to continue with the next step in our hardware platform. Currently, the hardware is rented from OVH, which has advantages but also disadvantages. We do not have access to the physical hardware and for example therefore cannot test with GPUs. Our ambition is to find a hardware supplier or vendor that can help {{site.title}} grow by sponsoring new hardware. This also offers the possibility to test different hardware components on the platform. Would you like to know more about the advantages for you as a supplier? Please contact us via info[at]{{site.title}}.com.

A big thank you to all our members, sponsors [ICT-Partners](https://www.ict-partners.nl){:target="_blank"} and [Login VSI](https://www.loginvsi.com){:target="_blank"} but especially you, our readers! Happy new year and see you in 2020!
