GO-EUC publishes & uses NetScaler deployments with best practice settings. Please mind that best practice is not always 'best solution', especially in research.
These settings should assist you in getting a solid out of the box deployment going, that is easily re-deployable.
The code is capable of both deployment and configuration.
You can find the complete repository [here](https://github.com/GO-EUC/go-euc-lab/tree/develop/terraform/citrix-adc){:target="_blank"}.

#### Please review the tables for an updated overview.

| Deployment Type | Supported |
| -------- | ------- |
| ESXI     | ✅      |
| Azure    | Planned |
| AWS      | Planned |

## Prerequisites

#### NetScaler
A NetScaler would be advised.

#### Credentials
Administrative credentials for the NetScaler are required.

#### A  `.tfvar` file
Please find the `.tfvar` file example [here](#tfvar).

#### License
A license is required for some deployment types, but freemium is supported.
Depending on your license type, you need to edit the `.tfvar` (see example) boolean value:

```
base_configuration = ({
  # Deploy advanced features (if licensed with advanced or above only!)
  advanced = true
})
```

| Deployment Type | Supported | Advanced Boolean Value|
| -------- | ------- | ------- |
| Freemium    | ✅ | False
| Standard    | ✅ | False
| Advanced    | ✅ | True
| Premium    | ✅ | True


## Architecture

The goal of the Terraform code's architecture is to give flexibility and provide a baseline best practice deployment. Your needs can differ if you want to use this code for production deployments, but it should provide a good start if you want to create a custom deployment.
### Variables
The goal of the Terraform code's architecture is to give flexibility and provide a baseline best practice deployment. Your needs can differ if you want to use this code for production deployments, but it should provide a good start if you want to create a custom deployment.

Throughout the code,  a `.tfvar` file will be used. A baseline `.tfvar` file will be [supplied in this article](#tfvar).  It's adviced to use this approach as it makes it easy to create multiple deployments. If you are not familiair with `.tfvar` files, please review the [official terraform documentation.](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/values/variables){:target="_blank"}


We want to maintain a proper code base where reproducability is at the core. It needs to be easy to use and edit for the sake of research.



### NetScaler Settings

The code deploys best practices out of the box. Please find the tables / documentation below.

#### NetScaler Modes (Enabled / Disabled)

| Mode | Default | Actual|
| -------- | ------- | ------- |
| Fast Ramp    | ✅ | ✅
| Use Source IP    | ❌ | ❌
| TCP Buffering    | ❌ | ❌
| Edge Configuration    | ✅ | ✅
| Layer 3 Mode    | ✅ | ❌
| Static Route Advertisement   | ❌ | ❌
| Intranet Route Advertisement   | ❌ | ❌
| IPv6 Route Advertisement   | ❌ | ❌
| Media Classification   | ❌ | ❌
| Layer 2 Mode   | ❌ | ❌
| Client side Keep Alive  | ❌ | ❌
| MAC based forwarding   | ❌ | ❌
| Use Subnet IP   | ✅ | ✅
| Path MTU Discovery   | ✅ | ✅
| Direct Route Advertisement   | ❌ | ❌
| IPv6 Static Route Advertisement   | ❌ | ❌
| Bridge BPDUs   | ❌ | ❌
| ULFD   | ❌ | ❌
